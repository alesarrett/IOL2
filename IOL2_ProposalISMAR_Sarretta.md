# Institute of Open Leadership 2 Proposal

## Title
Definition of a data policy for marine research data in the Institute of Marine Sciences

## Context

The Institute of Marine Sciences (ISMAR) is a research institute part of the Italian National Research Council (CNR). It's the biggest institute in Italy in the marine field, conducting research in Mediterranean, oceanic and polar regions, focusing on the evolution of oceans and their continental margins, studying submarine volcanoes, faults and slides; the influence of climate change on oceanic circulation, acidification, bio-geochemical cycles and marine productivity; submarine habitats and ecology, and the increasing pollution of coastal and deep-sea environments; the evolution of fish stocks; natural and anthropogenic factors impacting economically and socially on coastal systems.

This diverse set of interests produces a great variety of data with very different needs about analysis, processing, storage, dissemination.

During the last 10 years, ISMAR participated in various initiatives at national and international level to make available research data in a standard and interoperable way (e.g. INSPIRE, EMODnet, SeaDataNet, Copernicus, â€¦) and developed some portals (with open source software) to make data accessible (e.g. CIGNo (http://cigno.ve.ismar.cnr.it/), ADRIPLAN Data Portal (http://data.adriplan.eu/)).

In the very last years, ISMAR also developed a couple of documents to define data policies for specific projects, suggesting the use of Creative Commons Licences (ADRIPLAN (http://adriplan.eu/), RITMARE (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1235546)) but a comprehensive policy for all the data of the Institute, both for internal and external purposes is still missing.

## Proposal
The objective of this proposal is to learn how the CC Licences can be applied to the diverse set of data produced by the Institute of Marine Sciences maximizing the value and the reuse of data and promoting an open culture of sharing scientific knowledge.
For this purpose various steps can be foreseen:
* **Increase awareness** about benefits of openness among researchers through specific seminars and workshops
* Study how the range of **Creative Commons Licences** can be applied to the different types of marine research data
* Propose **procedures and best practices** on how the exchange of information and data with open licences can improve the quality and effectiveness of the research
* **Develop an open data policy** for the whole Institute of Marine Sciences to be applied in the data portals and dissemination activities
* Use this example as a **show case** to foster the development and adoption of open data policies in other Institutes and European and International activities dealing with Marine Research Data.
* Assess the success of the initiative monitoring the quantity and quality of data made available and used.

# Expected outcomes
With this initiative we expect to increase awareness both in the Institute and in the wider marine community about the importance and benefits of using Creative Commons licences for Marine Research Data.
We also expect that the amount and quality of data made available to the research community and the general public will increase and will maximize its reuse.
Among other benefits, we think also that the visibility of data of ISMAR will help to improve the dissemination of the results of its studies and so the possible collaborations with other researchers in the field.
